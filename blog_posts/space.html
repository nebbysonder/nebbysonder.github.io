                        <p>I'm back at Oberlin! The liminal time between fall and spring semesters always feels odd. I'm acting as both DLEC and MemCo for TWC... or what I like to call "Head of Schemes / CApTaIn".</p>

                        <p>Winter Term is not nearly as lonely as anticipated, though I am always missing [RE(dact)ED]. Ehhh.</p>
                        <p>My Winter Term project itself has been pretty chill. We just hang out and talk about traans-portation. Not even all day; like an hour a day on weekdays.</p>
                        <p>This blog isn't getting increasingly chaotic as I promised, but I did do some redecorating. I hope you enjoy the new coat of paint. I'll probably change it again soon.</p>
                        <p>I will be more coherent laterrrr. Here is today's post. The next one will come sooner-ish.</p>
