                                <p>Happy New Year! I forgot to warn you that my blog will become more and more silly with respect to formatting and maybe content as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGahtrFXWFQ" class="post_link">time goes by</a>. </p>
                                <p><em>Poor Things</em> was an interesting movie. A bit ableist in some respects. It was visually and intellectually captivating though.</p>
                                <p>New Years' was so much fun! I got to spend it with two people I love very much. We climbed a lot of hills, went to a record store, did a simple ethnography on two different party scenes, got boba, and celebrated life with a bunch of giggles and silliness. I wouldn't have had it any other way.</p>

                                <p>Sitting in the suspicious grass of Dolores Park, we discussed ins and outs of the new year. </p>
                                <p>Here are mine, some of which I've adapted from that conversation:</p>

                                    <li>Ins:</li>

                                <p>I am going back to Oberlin tomorrow. I have to wake up early for my flight. It seems that my winter term project also requires us to make a web portfolio. We are supposed to do it on Digication. I hate Digication. I'll teach myself to love it. That's what I said about chemistry.</p> 
                                <p>I ask you to view the way my words are displayed in this blog post as a sort of journey for yourself. </p>
                                <p>When I was with my friends a couple days ago, we found one of those stone spiral mazes. </p>
                                <p>The beauty of the maze is you can step over the rocks if you please, but you still choose to follow the path because of the journey it takes you on. </p>
                                <p>Walk with me.</p>

                                <p>What a fantastic start to the new year! I hope all of you readers are enacting joy in your day-to-days. We see each other best when we are facing each other. I don't think the yearning will stop though. I am quite the yearner. LOL </p>
