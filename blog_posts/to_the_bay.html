                        <p>Woo! My first blog post! I flew into the Bay Area from my home in Tucson yesterday. I am joined by my brother Christopher and my sister Sophia. We are staying with our grandparents.</p>

                        <p>Ruby is also staying here, because my cousins are away on vacation. We took her on a walk in the park today. One of the paths was blocked off for construction, so my grandma took us on a winding detour through a neighborhood to get us where we were trying to go.</p>
                        <p>Tomorrow, I plan to hang out with Alice and Mailynne! I am very excited, especially since I haven't seen Alice in what feels like an eternity. We will be watching <em>Poor Things</em>. It's bound to be a splendid time!</p>
                        <p>My other brother Steven will be joining us on Tuesday. He decided to stay back to finish up college applications. Christopher is also working hard on college applications. I hope my brothers find themselves in places that make them happy. I've also slowly begun working on an application for a summer research program. GRARARARARRARAAHHH!!!</p>
                        <p>I still don't know what to prioritize outside of my winter term project. I don't even really know what my winter term project is!</p>
                        <p>"Private Lives and Public Transportation"â€”I know the title, and I've read the project description, but I'm still not completely sure what it is that we'll be doing.</p>
                        <p>I'm also the winter term DLEC for TWC, which I'm excited about, but I just know that it's going to be chaos (lol). I want to get better at cooking over winter term. I plan to get Ohio PIC certified, and I imagine I'll be on quite a few cook shifts, because we won't have many people to fill them.</p>
                        <p>I also want to finish my application, look for more summer opportunites, practice my Chinese, and read a couple of books. I'm sure I'm forgetting other things I want to do. I need to prioritize.</p>
                        <p>In addition to all of that, I of course plan to maintain this blog and learn more about web development. Oh, my! Oh, my! There's so much to do! And I want to hang out with people often!! ARGGGhh.</p>
                        <p>Anyways, I don't have to do it all. I should be using some of this time to rest and recuperate. I'll be chillin'.</p>
                        <p>Hmmm... I feel like this is a good stopping point. Until next time! ;)</p>
